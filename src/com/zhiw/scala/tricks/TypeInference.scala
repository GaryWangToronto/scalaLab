    /* Scala is a static type safe language. It applies Progress which means:A well typed (typable) program never gets "stuck".
     * The expressions in the program will either be evaluated to a "value", or there is a transition rule for it.
     * 
     * When we do String a = "some string"; in Java, Java looks at the left side and see String, looks at the right side and see a 
     * String type of value. Once left side type matches right side value type, it passes the evaluation.
     * In Scala, Scala introduced Type Inference which means it can inference your type out. Like val a = "some string" We don't need 
     * to tell Scala what "a" is because Scala can evaluate the right side as String then automatically assign String type to the left.
     *  
     * Now let's assume we have a function definition as method (a) = a, when compiler starts to evaluate it (static language means using
     * compiler to check type safe). It looks at the left side. What is type of a? Unknown. So it assume it is type T. What is the return 
     * type? Still undefined. It assume it to type U. Then it check the right side. The right side returns value a. So now the compiler 
     * knows return value type should be the same as the type of value a. Which is T. But what is T? Now the compiler be totally screwed. 
     * Then natually, T comes to the world. So now we can define the method as method[T](p:T) = p. To let compiler knows this type will be 
     * defined later. This can be called parameterized polymorphism.
